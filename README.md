Task "Async Race"
Your customer has an idea to spend his money. He has hired some engineers who installed some radio-controlled equipment ðŸ“» to real cars ðŸš—. To the all his collection of cars to be precise. He is eager to create kind of drag-racing competition in order to discover which car fastest.

Each radio-contorller has an HTTP-compatible interface. It's let you to start or stop engine of the car and of course enable "driving" mode.

Your task is to create SPA to manage the collection of the cars, operate its engines, and show races statistics.

Previously development of this application has been started by some belarusian developer Dzmitry (and was almost finished). But his laptop ðŸ’» was stolen by bad guys. And we don't have any sources of UI ðŸ˜ž. But fortunately he has recorded some demo before - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTXtlBLh-Ts. And also he has stored the server-mock in his repo - https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api.
We have found in the latest news that a new company called "The Fast and the Furious" announced about releasing a new product that will really blow people's minds. There is no a lot of info about this product. All we know it's about "easier cars' management that you can imagine". It's exactly our thiefs :suspect:. They're going to release their product in two weeks. But we can't allow them to do that. We must be first.

What are you waiting for? Let's coding!
